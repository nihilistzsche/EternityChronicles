This document highlights the differences between Dragon 1.0 and Dragon WIP.

If constructs without an else have an implicit else block that returns the default value for the type of the then block.
Everything in Dragon returns a value, and this requires the else block to have a return value.
If you have a block like if (x % 2 == 1) { x + 2; } The interpreter treats it like (assuming x is an int):
if (x % 2 == 1) { x + 2; } else { default(int); } (Again, if you made this explicit, the cast would be
automatic).

Dragon does not create static .NET classes in the runtime, which Dragon does do in the Objective-C runtime.  Instead, Dragon uses the DLR to construct dynamic instances with binders that provide much richer access to dynamic facilities.
